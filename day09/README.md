- CSS is the Language for styling web pages, describing the presentation of documents written in Markup languages
- CSS ruleset  has three sections, a selector, property and value in the following syntax
```css
selector{
    property-1: value-1;
    property-2: value-2;
    property-n: value-n;
}
```
- CSS has several units of  measurement that can be used to specify the size and position of elements on a web page. Some of the most commonly used units include:
        - __px__ (Pixels) - Pixels are fixed-size units that are used to specify the size and position of elements on a screen.

        - __em__ - The 'em' unit is a relative unit based on the font-size of the parent element. 1em is equal to the current font size. E.g. if the font-size of the parent element is 16px, then 1em is equal to 16px, 2em is equal to 32px, etc.

        - __rem__ The 'rem' unit is also relative but it is based on the font-size of the root element (usually the <html> element) instead of the parent element.

        - __%__ - The percentage unit is a relative unit based on the size of the parent element. For example, if an element is set to have a width of 50%, it will be half the width of its parent element.

        - __vh__ and __vw__ - These are relative units based on the size of the viewport. 1vw is equal to 1% of the viewport width and 1vh is equal to 1% of the viewport height.

        - __calc__ - This is a special function in CSS that allows you to perform calculations to determine the size and position of elements. It can be used to combine different units of measurement.
