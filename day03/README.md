## Day 03 of 90 
In our [previous](../day02) session, we discussed HTTP and its  role in Websites. Today, we will have a look at what DNS is and why is it important. 

## Intro
DNS is the phonebook of the internet. It maps domain names to the respective IP addresses. Web servers where websites are hosted have addresses known as IP addresses to identify them (an example is google.com  whose IP address is 172.217.170.206). You can copy and paste the adress directly into your browser and you will be taken to [Google's](https://google.com) home page.

 Since the addresse are really complex, DNS helps us by giving us the chance to remeber the domain (google.com) instead of the  very complex numbers. It takes care of translating the domain names into their respective addresse. Cool Right?
